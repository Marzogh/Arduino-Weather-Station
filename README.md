Arduino-Weather-Station
===============
This project aims to build a working weather station that can measure and report a number of environmental variables including:

- Temperature
- Relative humidity
- Wind speed
- Wind direction
- Rainfall
- Ambient light`
- UV`
- Lightning`
- CO<sub>2</sub> levels`
- SO<sub>2</sub> levels`

`In future updates
